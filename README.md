Hello there! I'm a developer and researcher passionate about the intricate systems that drive our world, from the digital logic of microprocessors to the complexities of human consciousness. My work is a continuous exploration of how information is processed, perceived, and transformed, whether in silicon or in the neural networks of the brain.

This space provides a glimpse into my journey as I navigate the fascinating intersections of technology, sound, and the mind. Here, you'll find projects that reflect my deep curiosity and my drive to build tools that are not only functional but also insightful.

### My Core Interests:

*   **🎹 Music Production & Synthesis:** I'm captivated by the creation of sound from the ground up. My explorations in synthesis and physical modeling are about more than just making music; they're about understanding the physics of sound and the algorithms that can replicate and manipulate it. This is where my love for engineering and art converges.

*   **🧠 Artificial Intelligence & Information Processing:** I am deeply engaged with how machines can learn and process information. My focus is on Large Language Models (LLMs) and the broader field of information processing, driven by a desire to understand and harness the power of AI to solve complex problems and augment human intellect.

*   **🔬 Neuroscience & Cognitive Psychology:** My ultimate fascination lies with the brain and the nature of consciousness. I am an avid learner in the fields of neuroscience and cognitive psychology, constantly seeking to understand the mechanisms of attention, perception, and what gives rise to our subjective experience. This interest informs my approach to AI, as I believe the path to truly intelligent systems lies in understanding the one truly intelligent system we know: the human brain.

### A Glimpse into My Work:

My repositories showcase a range of projects that embody these interests. You'll find explorations in low-level computing with a custom **microprocessor** design, ventures into the world of AI with tools like an **AI-powered Obsidian plugin** that leverages Google's Generative AI for structuring notes from various media, and even creative applications of AI in projects like evolving Pokémon battle strategies with neural networks. I've also delved into the fundamentals of information retrieval with a custom **search engine** built from scratch.

I believe in the power of interdisciplinary exploration and am always open to new ideas and collaborations. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you share any of these passions.
